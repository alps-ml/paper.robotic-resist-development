End of Arm Tooling
==================

This mounts the tweezer on a Mecademic Gripper MEGP 25LS.

The mount fits Techni Tool Tweezer [1] tips, but most of these tips are very similar.
To help on angular alignment, we use Dowel pins from Amazon (Dowel Pin, M1.5 x 6mm) e.g. these ones [2].

The tweezer tips are then only pressed into the 3d printed adapter.
They need to be printed twice and we print them with the screw recess towards the print plate.
